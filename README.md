# sing-box rule_sets localization
Automatically write all sing-box rule sets into json files

## About
As we all know, sing-box has a very useful feature - rule_set, which can bring you a lot of interesting ways to play, but it's not like xray's geoip geosite that downloads all rules locally for easy rule writing. The purpose of this script is to break this situation, so that sing-box can also be like xray, just a few simple steps to realize geo diversion without specifying a separate rule_set

## Requirements
Systems:
- Debian / Ubuntu
- CentOS / Fedora
- Arch Linux
- Maybe other similar distributions

Packages:
- Python
- git
- wget

## Usage
```
bash <(curl -L -s ruleset.reyreyy.net) [SUBCOMMAND]
```

## Subcommands
```
menu               Open menu.
generate           One-time generate, no additional changes.
install            Install the script, automatic update rule_set.json.
uninstall          Uninstall all the changes, including rule_set.json & geo files.
```

## Example
Install automaticlly write & update rule sets everyday.
```
bash <(curl -L -s ruleset.reyreyy.net) install
```
Open menu choose what you want to do.
```
bash <(curl -L -s ruleset.reyreyy.net) menu
```

## And what's now?
Just write the sing-box rules as you would the xray rules, although the details may be a little different, but the script is really helpful!

## Json sample

    "route": {
        "rules": [
            {

                "outboundTag": "warp-out"
            },
            {
                "ip": "geoip:cn",
                "outboundTag": "warp-out"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Thanks
Thanks for ChatGPT <br>
The script is 90% generated by ChatGPT, I just made a small modification. <br>
I actually don't know how to coding. :\
